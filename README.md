## About The Project

Upon first run, you will be prompted to login. You will have 60 seconds to complete the login process manually on the site with the chrome browser that popsup. After that, the bot will run as usual and you should not need to login again as cookies will inject everytime thereafter:

Steps:

1. Insert link to restraunt

2. Input a scheduled time (if applicable, 00:00:00 format, military time)

3. Enter a monitor delay (OT doesn't ban, enter 0 for best results)

4. After page is loaded, pay attention to the time and date. Bot does NOT change date and time schedule for you. You will have to be quick and change it manually before a webpage refresh. You can do this in multiple takes. e.g: Click desired date on first refresh. Click a time on the next refresh.

F.Y.I: Bot is not perfect. If a time pops up and it is in a weird placement, the bot will not grab it. This is due to the sites HTML, odd placements, and my lack of expereince.
